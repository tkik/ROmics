```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

S4 classes are the perfect examples of the OO programming:
- stricter structure
- they have representations: a list of slots or arguments by name and class
- the slots have to have the correct type
- methods - they also inherit the methods from the classes of the arguments, but inheritence is between S4 classes as well. 
- has to be created with the new constructor
- they have accessor methods as well.

```{r}
setClass("Person", representation(name = "character", age = "numeric"))
setClass("Employee", representation(boss = "Person"), contains = "Person")

person1 <- new("Person", name="Peter", age=34)
boss1 <- new("Employee", boss=person1, name="Lisa", age=36)
```

```{r}

person1
boss1

```

Example class: SummarizedExperiment

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
    knitr::include_graphics("https://compgenomr.github.io/book/images/Summarized.Experiment.png", dpi = 100)
    ```


Representation:


`RangedSummarizedExperiment` is an extension of `SummarizedExperiment`. It uses `GRanges` to define the genomic regions. 


```{r}
library(SummarizedExperiment)
library(airway)
data("airway")

se <- airway

```
## Accessors

To know all this, look for the help and the vignette. 

```{r}
colData(se)
rowData(se)
#assay(se)
rowRanges(se)
#assays(se)[[1]]
head(assays(se)$counts)

head(metadata(airway))

```

You can access each data "natively", and even change it, but you shouldn't do that. 
Why? It is easy to screw it up...


```{r}
se@rowRanges
se@metadata

###don't do this:
se@rowRanges <- se@rowRanges[1:3000]
se
se@rowRanges


```

## Methods 

### subsetting


```{r}
# subsetting is very easy, just like with a data.frame

se <- se[1:2000,]

se <- se[,1:3]

se

```

### Combining

```{r}

rowbinded <- rbind(se, se)
rowbinded
colbinded <- cbind(se, se)
colbinded

```
```{r}
roi <- GRanges(seqnames="X", ranges=99800000:99850000)
se_1 <- subsetByOverlaps(se, roi)



```
